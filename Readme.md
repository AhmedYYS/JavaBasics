# bubble Sort
* bubbleSort is a very popular algorithm in which given an array of numbers it would sort from lowest to highest swapping in twos.

# Fibonacci Sequence
* the fibonacci sequence is a very popular maths tool. It is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. For this task I used recursion.

# Palindrome
* a palindrome is a word in which spelt backwards would still mean the same thing. My method would take a sentence and check if there are any palindromes within.



*the array practice and TDD are both methods in which find the second highest number and adds all of the numbers within an array and returns a int respectively.*
